# Deterministic Builds

Deterministic Builds uses eBPF to intercept syscalls, to build same binaries from same source on Linux. You can start eBPF programs and then just run build tasks while this tool is making your build deterministic transparently.

## Method

Intercept syscalls related to time and make their return values fixed. eBPF can only modify syscalls which pass pointers to parameters using [BPF helper](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/bpf-helpers.7.html) function `bpf_probe_read_user`.

### Time

Three syscalls about time are `gettimeofday`, `clock_gettime` and `time`. eBPF intercepts `gettimeofday` and `clock_gettime`. eBPF can not intercept `time`, so preload library is used to return fixed value, which modifies function `time` in glibc. To make the 

### File

A file is usually read by syscalls including `openat`, `newstatat` and `read` or `mmap`. eBPF intercepts these syscalls to modify file name, file timestamps and file contents. 

## Prerequisites

The kernel version should be at least 5.8. To compile eBPF programs and preload shared objects, you will need `clang`, `libelf`, `zlib`, `build-essential`.

On Ubuntu:
```
apt install clang libelf1 libelf-dev zlib1g-dev build-essential
```

## Usage

### Configuration

You can specify the modified timestamp to modify in `./config/time_config.h`.

### Work with Docker

1. Check and turn off [vDSO](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/vdso.7.html), making it possible for eBPF programs to intercept syscalls about time. You can run `turn_off_vdso.sh` as `root`. It will add `vdso=0` flag to `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT` in `/etc/default/grub`, and it run a reboot to make it take effect. You can also do this manually.
2. Build and Run Docker as `root`.
```shell
docker build -t deterministic_builds .
docker run -it deterministic_builds
```
3. Start eBPF interception in the host OS, run script as `root`.
```shell
./start.sh
```
4. Run compile in Docker.
5. Stop eBPF interception.
```shell
./stop.sh
```

## Examples

Run examples with docker:

```bash
# build images normally
docker build -t example .
# build images use Chinese package manager mirrors
docker build -t example . -f Dockerfile.cn

# run container
docker run -it example
# enter the shell
docker exec -it <CONTAINER ID> /bin/bash
```

### gcc macros

Some macros in gcc can lead to nondeterminacy in compilation.

Including:

- `__DATE__`
- `__TIME__`
- `__TIMESTAMP__`
- `__FILE__`

### Kernel Compilation

There are some timestamps and random fields in binary file `vmlinux`, the compiled result of linux kernel.

## Dependencies

The eBPF program in this project is developed based on libbpf-bootstap.
